# User Guide

Welcome to the SecurIoTy web app!

This will be a comprehensive guide on how to find your way around our Internet of Things learning app. This guide will be split into two sections: Student and Instructor.

## Student Section

To start let's talk a bit about how a student can utilize this app to learn!

When designing this app we tried to make it as easy as possible for students to get quickly into learning. Here are a few basic steps.

1. **Account Creation**:
    - All users are required to be logged in with a valid account. Let's first create an account. Find the button in the top right of the navbar and click on it to open the account creation popup.

2. **Account Setup**:
    - You will now be presented with an option to switch the form to account creation mode. Click that button now to render the additional field required for an account. (Note: An EWU email is recommended but any email will suffice)

3. **Account Creation**:
    - Now you are able to enter your information and click to submit to create your account!

4. **Accessing Labs**:
    - Now that you are logged in, we can get into the fun part, your first lab! First, close the login form using the 'close' button or clicking outside of the form. Now you will see the labs available on the homepage.

6. **Progress Tracking**:
    - After you complete a few questions, you may notice a few things. Firstly once you answer a question, you will be shown a message indicating whether you are correct or incorrect. In the case you are correct, your progress will be displayed on the top progress bar and bound to your account, meaning it will be there if you leave and come back.

7. **Profile Page**:
    - You might have noticed when we logged in earlier, the profile button that appeared in the top right of your screen. Let's click on that now to see what we are given. Here is your profile page with all of your progress history for each attempted lab. As you can see here, we have completed 50% of Test Lab in this demo.

This concludes the student section, however if you are an Instructor please view the next steps as they will give you the knowledge of your advanced privileges. Instructors have all the capabilities of students, with additional features to manage them as well.

## Instructor Section

8. **Instructor Registration**:
    - As you can see here, the registration once Instructor is selected is a little different. You must enter a secret key given to you by SecurIoTy administration. Please be aware that with access to this key, others will be able to access features that are designed to be exclusive to higher users.
