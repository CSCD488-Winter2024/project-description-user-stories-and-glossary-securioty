# SecurIoTy

## Project summary

This project proposes a web-based lab platform to train cybersecurity students on practical skills to combat the unique security challenges of the expanding Internet of Things field.

### Additional information about the project

SecurIoTy strives to allow cybersecurity students and professionals the ability to easily learn about IoT security challenges. Through our website students may take on different labs detailing security vulnerabilities in IoT devices so students may learn how to prevent them. Labs will come with a prebuilt virtual machine for students to interact with while they are conducting their lab to help gain hands on experience.
